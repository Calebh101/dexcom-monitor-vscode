# What is this?

This is an extremely simple extension to let you view your glucose levels while coding. It's not meant to be a tool; it's meant to be a little tab you can place in the corner of the screen.

Features:
- Shows current glucose level and trend
- Shows previous glucose level and trend
- Shows how long it was since your last reading

I might update this extension with new features in the future.

# What is this using?
